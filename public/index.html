										A mask can only stop so much we need more. One proven method of counter protection is partition seperation and the materials of choice are acrylic or 
										polycarbonate sheet. The reason for this is acrylics and polycarbonates are many times stronger and lighter 
										than glass is more flexible so can be molded or bent to practically any shape and much cheaper. Of the two 
										acrylic is generally the cheaper and more malliable. We can supply you with some standards 
										sizes or the better option is for us to come around and measure and quote depending 
										on you situation we can cater to your needs.

										We are currently offering counter top 
										shields that offer a high degree of protection against droplet propergation. Unfortunately, the germs that fly out from your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze 
										travel much further than we might think. Offering a true physical barrier our acryic screens 
										can help protect your colleagues from this event. A sneeze or cough can travel at speeds of upto 
										100 miles an hour and a distance from 19 to 26 feet according to a study from 
										the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Below is some common measurements 
										that may help but please contact us regarding your specific measurements and we can custom 
										make our shields to your requirements.

									<h3>UV-C Germicidal Lamps</h3>
									
									<p>UV disinfection lights are revolutionizing the way people and businesses impose or maintain sanitation standards.
									 Using the UV-C range, or wavelengths between 200 nm and 280 nm, 
									 the units are capable of eliminating up to 99% percent of dangerous viruses, bacteria, mold, 
									 spores and other harmful microbes, including the COVID-19 corona virus. 
									 It can achieve this rate without needing to come in direct contact with the surface or object.
									</p>
									
									<p>Unlike other technologies, UV-C germicidal lights are tried and tested in the field and in 
										various operating environments. Even before the spread of COVID-19, UV lamps were already being used 
										to disinfect products on manufacturing lines, treat water in wastewater plants and passively clean hard-to-reach 
										sections of HVAC systems (coils, pans and vents). The wide and successful application of UV sanitation lights in these industries 
										reinforces their use cases during the COVID-19 pandemic.
									</p>
									<h3>What the Science Says</h3>
									<blockquote>
										The experimental tests showed very high 
										effectiveness of UV-C light to eliminate high bacterial inocula. 
										The sanitizing method employed by this device affects a very wide 
										range of microorganisms and it has several advantages respect to 
										chemical based-sanitizing methods. This practice has been effective 
										and requires less personal than the manual cleaning and disinfection 
										based on chemical agents. UV-C radiation inactivates microorganisms causing 
										DNA damage by producing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), altering DNA structure, 
										and thus interfering with DNA replication.
									</blockquote> 									
									<blockquote>
											UVC sanitation is the safest method for getting rid of unwanted bacteria, 
											viruses, yeast, and even mold. Unlike disinfectant chemicals, 
											UV-C light does not leave any residue once the cleaning cycle is over. 
											That is why UVC light is being used more frequently by healthcare professionals, 
											and those who have members in their household who are susceptible to chemicals like kids, 
											the elderly, and pets.
